## Purpose
This is the Framework created for [Empire Minecraft](https://ref.emc.gs/Aikar?gac=commands.github).

ACF Started as a Bukkit Command Framework, but has shifted to be platform agnostic and can be used on any Java based application.

ACF is an extremely powerful command framework that takes nearly every concept of boilerplate code commonly found in command handlers, and abstracts them away behind annotations.

ACF redefines how you build your command handlers, allowing things such as Dependency Injection, Validation, Tab Completion, Help Documentation, Syntax Advice, and Stateful Conditions to all be behind Annotations that you place on methods.

Clean up your command handlers and unleash rich command experiences that would be too burdensome to pull off manually.

## Beta Testing
While the 0.x.x series of ACF is "Beta", note that it is very stable.
It has been used for years on EMC. 


It is labeled Beta as the framework is growing fast and gaining new features, and API's are subject to breakage. The new features also may contain bugs, but we will work to fix them fast.

Please be prepared to keep up with changes, but I try to keep them as least disruptful as possible.

v1.0.0 will be the signal that ACF features are more complete and the API will remain stable for a long time.

## Documentation / Using ACF

[Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki) - All of ACF's documentation is currently on the GitHub Wiki. 
Please review every page to learn about each feature.

See [Using ACF](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki/Using-ACF) on how to add ACF to your plugin and getting started.

See [Examples](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki/Real-World-Examples) for some real world examples

## Targeted Platforms / Current Version

We are on version:
 - GROUP: co.aikar
 - VERSION `0.5.0-SNAPSHOT`

ARTIFACTID varies by platform target:
 * [Bukkit](https://spigotmc.org): ***acf-bukkit*** (For targetting Bukkit/Spigot)
 * [Paper](https://paper.emc.gs): ***acf-paper*** (Recommended over Bukkit, will gradually enhance when ran on Paper, but still runs on Spigot)
 * [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/): ***acf-sponge***
 * [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/): ***acf-bungee*** 
 * [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA): ***acf-jda*** - IN PROGRESS - NOT READY
 
Setup Guides (Repo and Requirements): [Maven](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki/Maven-Setup), [Gradle](https://github.com/aikar/commands/wiki/Gradle-Setup)
You may include more than 1 platform in your jar if your plugin supports multiple platforms.
    
Any bump in version implies an API break. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for information on migration guides for API breaks.
 
Every change that should not cause any API break will be deployed over the current version.

## Why does it require Java 8+?
Get off your dinosaur and get on this rocket ship!

Dinosaurs have been dead for a long time, so get off it before you start to smell.
